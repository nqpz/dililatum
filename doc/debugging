About debugging:
  Questy is a program never intended to be finished. Its built-in
  debugging features aid in the opposite.
  When debugging, you can add arguments from the command line. This is
  particularly useful when using a debug file. If both a debug file
  and a debug string is present, the string is prepended to the file
  contents.
  Debug code can be executed at different times using different
  signals that the Questy system emits.

  Examples:\
    Debug a game with a-debug-file.py
      $ questy -d a-debug-file.py A_GAME
    Do the same, but this time send 3 arguments to a-debug-file.py
      $ questy -d a-debug-file.py -a arg1 -a arg2 -a arg3 A_GAME
